## Neural Networks

- 2019 APS：A Photonic In-Memory Computing primitive for Spiking Neural Networks using Phase-Change Materials. (Purdue University, USA)

  - Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an event-driven and more biologically realistic alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks based on analog information processing. This can potentially enable energy-efficient hardware implementations of neuromorphic systems which emulate the functional units of the brain, namely, neurons and synapses. Recent demonstrations of ultra-fast photonic computing devices based on phase-change materials (PCMs) show promise of addressing limitations of electrically driven neuromorphic systems. However, scaling these standalone computing devices to a parallel in-memory computing primitive is a challenge. In this work, we utilize the optical properties of the PCM, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), to propose a Photonic Spiking Neural Network computing primitive, comprising of a non-volatile synaptic array integrated seamlessly with previously explored ‘integrate-and-fire’ neurons. The proposed design realizes an ‘in-memory’ computing platform that leverages the inherent parallelism of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM). We show that the proposed computing platform can be used to emulate a SNN inferencing engine for image classification tasks. The proposed design not only bridges the gap between isolated computing devices and parallel large-scale implementation, but also paves the way for ultra-fast computing and localized on-chip learning.
  
 
 ## Memristive Device
 
 - 2019 ISCAS: Memristive Device Based Circuits for Computation-in-Memory Architectures. (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands; Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia)
 
   - Emerging computing applications (such as big-data and Internet-of-things) are extremely demanding in terms of storage, energy and computational efficiency, while todays architectures and device technologies are facing major challenges making them incapable to meet these demands. Computation-in-Memory (CIM) architecture based on memristive devices is one of the alternative computing architectures being explored to address these limitations. Enabling such architectures relies on the development of efficient memristive circuits being able to perform logic and arithmetic operations within the non-volatile memory core. This paper addresses memristive circuit designs for CIM architectures. It gives a complete overview of all designs, both for logic as well as arithmetic operations, and presents the most popular designs in details. In addition, it analyzes and classifies them, shows how they result in different CIM flavours and how these architectures distinguish themselves from traditional ones. The paper also presents different potential applications that could significantly benefit from CIM architectures, based on their kernel that could be accelerated.
